Makan makanan berat hanya di siang hari saja ya gaes, karena tubuh kita masih memerlukan tenaga untuk beraktivitas dan jangan lupa untuk ajak teman, yang pastinya untuk nemenin makan seporsi berdua ya biar gak kebablasan.

Tapi harus hati-hati ya soalnya sering muncul kasus seperti Abstinence-violation effect yang menyebabkan kita hilang kontrol sehingga nafsu makan kita semakin lama semakin besar. Hmm.. ngeri juga ya gaes.. tidak heran jika orang-orang yang melakukan cheat day adalah orang-orang yang terlatih.</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sedangkan untuk cheating meals, hanya dilakukan dalam waktu-waktu tertentu contohnya saat makan siang.. hmm sebenarnya ini kurang baik dilakukan karena kita bisa saja kehilangan motivasi diet kita pada saat ini juga. Karena kurangnya motivasi yang ditimbulkan maka kadar leptin dapat menurun. Jadi sebaiknya hindari ini ya (apalagi jika kamu baru melakukan diet)</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tunggu dulu jangan di skip jangan di skip karena cheating itu gak harus makan makanan berkalori tinggi, walaupun diet kita juga bisa makan makanan enak dan healthy foods.. yuk intip 3 produknya</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Granola</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Salah satu favorite untuk sarapan, Oatmeal yang digabung dengan varian dried fruits pilihan serta campuran mix seeds nya menggoda selera.
