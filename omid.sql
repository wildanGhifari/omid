The nourishment of the body forms a foundation for nourishment of the mind and your emotions. Think of it this way.</p>', '<p>Imagine yourself devoting all your days to perfecting your yoga practice, and then sustaining your body only on high doses of sugar and caffeine. What kind of effect do you think it will have on you body, your emotions?</p>\r\n<p>Just as you commit yourself to your morning Pranayama and daily asanas, it is easy to see that a balanced mind can come easily to you if you commit yourself to nourish your body with the right kind of food. But how exactly do you do that?</p>\r\n<p>Extending your yoga practice to your dinner table is not an easy feat, mostly because the classic yogic philosophies do not list any specific foods for following a ‘yogic diet’. Moreover, even if our yogic ancestors did prescribe some sort of diet, it wouldn’t be easily available or appropriate today for each one of us.</p>\r\n<p>However, there is still a modern-day yogic diet, with ingredients that enhance clarity and lightness, keeping the body light and nourished and the mind clear. Eating organic food is a classic example of something that is better for both the body and the environment.</p>\r\n<h5>Close to Mother Earth</h5>\r\n<p>Our food choices have a tremendous effect on our physical and mental health, the quality of our subtle energy, our meditation and spiritual practice, the economy of the world, and the ecological health of Earth. By becoming mindful and aware of our food choices, we can help address many issues.</p>\r\n<p>The organic food diet, much like yoga, supports one’s spiritual practice. It includes fresh, healthy, free-from chemicals food that is close to its natural form, that provides all necessary nutrients, and that is prepared in a spiritually pure atmosphere, having minimal impact on the Earth’s ecological health.</p>\r\n<h5>Eating Fresh</h5>\r\n<p>We evolved eating foods fresh from the ground, or tree. Foods were not stored or processed. When foods are in their fresh, natural state, their subtle energy is intact, and we receive and absorb that energy when we eat whole foods. Once a food is picked or stored, its energy begins to leak. In addition, foods begin to lose their nutritional value as soon as they’re picked or processed.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Just like yoga, by eating organic food, we are trying to build up a bank of energy. The more energy we have, the better the progress we make. To preserve and build this energy, our food, just like our yoga practice, must be full of vitality. This will not only improve health, but heighten spiritual consciousness, reduce pollution, destruction, and global greenhouse gas emissions for a better future for us and our future generations.</p>', 'yoga-food-and-an-organic-diet-20210112102253.jpg');
